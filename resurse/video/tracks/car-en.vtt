hi Paul from challenger again I just

00:02.000--> 00:08.000 line:1
thought to show you the tread wear

00:08.000 --> 00:13.000 line:0
indicator a new tire on where to find it

00:08.000 --> 00:13.000 line:1
if you look on the sidewall of the tire

00:13.000 --> 00:19.000 line:0
that is a little marking saying Twi

00:13.000 --> 00:19.000 line:1
which is tread wear indicator and if you

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000 line:0
can see on the tire there's in between

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000 line:1
the grooves there are little raised

00:22.000 --> 00:28.000 line:0
lumps when they become level with your

00:22.000 --> 00:28.000 line:1
finger that is a sign that the tire is

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000 line:0
ready for replacements we took off a car

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000 line:1
recently

00:32.000 --> 00:38.000 line:0
you can see how is how it is a straight

00:32.000 --> 00:38.000 line:1
line that this one is actually below

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000 line:0
legal requirement
